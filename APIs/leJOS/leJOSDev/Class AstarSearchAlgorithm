Class AstarSearchAlgorithm

    java.lang.Object
        lejos.robotics.pathfinding.AstarSearchAlgorithm 

    All Implemented Interfaces:
        SearchAlgorithm


    public class AstarSearchAlgorithm
    extends java.lang.Object
    implements SearchAlgorithm

    This is an implementation of the A* search algorithm. Typically this object would be instantiated and then used in a NodePathFinder constructor, along with a set of connected nodes.

            findPath

            public Path findPath(Node start,
                                 Node goal)

            Description copied from interface: SearchAlgorithm
            Method accepts a start node and a goal node, and returns a path consisting of a collection of waypoints which includes the startNode coordinates as the first waypoint, and the goal node coordinates as the final waypoint. Note: The startNode must be connected with other nodes (neighbors) that eventually connect to the goalNode.

            Specified by:
                findPath in interface SearchAlgorithm
            Returns:
                A collection of waypoints. Returns null if it fails to find a path.
