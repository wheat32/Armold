    public interface BaseMotor

    Base motor interface. Contains basic movement commands.

        Method Summary
        All MethodsInstance MethodsAbstract Methods Modifier and Type 	Method and Description
        void 	backward()
        Causes motor to rotate backwards until stop() or flt() is called.
        void 	flt()
        Motor loses all power, causing the rotor to float freely to a stop.
        void 	forward()
        Causes motor to rotate forward until stop() or flt() is called.
        boolean 	isMoving()
        Return true if the motor is moving.
        void 	stop()
        Causes motor to stop immediately.

        Method Detail
            forward

            void forward()

            Causes motor to rotate forward until stop() or flt() is called.
            backward

            void backward()

            Causes motor to rotate backwards until stop() or flt() is called.
            stop

            void stop()

            Causes motor to stop immediately. It will resist any further motion. Cancels any rotate() orders in progress.
            flt

            void flt()

            Motor loses all power, causing the rotor to float freely to a stop. This is not the same as stopping, which locks the rotor.
            isMoving

            boolean isMoving()

            Return true if the motor is moving.

            Returns:
                true if the motor is currently in motion, false if stopped.
