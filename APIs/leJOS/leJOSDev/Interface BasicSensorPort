        Method Detail
            getMode

            int getMode()

            Get the current operating mode of the sensor

            Returns:
                the current mode

            getType

            int getType()

            Get the current type setting. Note that types are typically used to control the operation of Legacy and i2c sensors. They are normally not used for EV3 sensors.

            Returns:
                the current sensor type

            setMode

            boolean setMode(int mode)

            Set the current operating mode for the sensor attached to the port.

            Parameters:
                mode - the new mode
            Returns:
                true if the mode has been accepted

            setType

            boolean setType(int type)

            Set the operating type for the attached sensor. Normally type setting is only used with legacy sensors and for i2c devices (to set the speed and operating voltage). It is not normally used with EV3 sensors.

            Parameters:
                type - 
            Returns:
                true if type accepted

            setTypeAndMode

            @Deprecated
            boolean setTypeAndMode(int type,
                                                int mode)

            Deprecated.
