            locate

            java.util.ArrayList<java.lang.Double> locate()

            This method performs a scan around the robot. The angle values are always relative to the robot, because it does not know which direction it is facing. 0 degrees is the forward direction the robot is facing. Angle increases counter-clockwise from 0. So 90 degrees is to the left of the robot, 180 is behind, and 270 is to the right.

            Returns:
                an ArrayList of double values indicating angles to the beacons
