     * <p>Instruments are defined in the Sounds interface, which is inherited by this class.

     * <code>public final static int[] PIANO = new int[]{4, 25, 500, 7000, 5};</code>
     * 
     * <p>The parameter len is the total time of the note to be played
     * val 0 is the attack time the time for the volume to go from near zero to 100%
     * val 1 is the decay time during this period the volume decreases by val[2]/100 
     * to the sustain level.
     * the sustain period is (len - val[0] - val[1] - val[4]) during this period the 
     * volume decreases by val[3]/100.
     * the final decay period is val[4] and the volume reduces to zero.
     * All of the times are units of 2mS (except for len which is in mS).</p>
     * <p>Because values equal 2ms, the piano array numbers are doubled:<br>
     * 1. take 8mS to increase the volume from zero to 100%<br>
     * 2. take 50mS to decrese the volume by 5%<br>
     * 3. take len - 8 - 25 - 10 mS to decrease the volume by 70%<br>
     * 4. take 10mS to decrease the volume to 0</p>
