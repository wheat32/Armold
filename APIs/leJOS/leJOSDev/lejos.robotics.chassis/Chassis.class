/**
 * Represents the chassis of a robot. The Chassis provides a control system for driving a mobile robot. 
 * 
 * <p><b>How to use a Chassis object</b><br>
 * The primary goal of the chassis is to make a robot move. 
 * This can be done in two different ways. <br>
 * One way is by specifying the speed at which a chassis should move, this is called velocity mode. 
 * The primary methods for this mode are {@link #setVelocity(double, double) setVelocity} and {@link #stop() stop} .<br>
 * The second way is by specifying  the kind of move the chassis should make, this is called move mode. 
 * The primary methods for this mode are {@link #arc(double, double) arc}, {@link #rotate(double) rotate} and {@link #travel(double) travel}.
 * The move mode methods use speed and acceleration parameters that have to be specified beforehand using {@link #setSpeed(double, double) setSpeed} 
 * and {@link #setAcceleration(double, double) setAcceleration}. <br>
 * Depending on the application one of these modes will suit better, but the modes can be used together.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Understanding linear and angular velocity and acceleration</b><br>
 * Within the context of the chassis speed and acceleration have both a linear and an angular component. 
 * The linear component describes the forward speed (or acceleration) of the robot. 
 * It specifies the speed of the robot traveling a straight line using the same unit as was used to specify the wheels of the chassis.
 * The linear speed is always the speed of the center of the robot, when driving an arc the forward speed of the outer wheel exceeds the speed of the center of the chassis.<br>
 * The angular component of speed (or acceleration) describes how fast the robot is turning around its center. This is always expressed in degrees/second. <br>
 * When using velocity based methods the chassis combines both speed elements to calculate the speed of each of the wheels. 
 * This results in a movement of the robot that can be anything from a rotation around its center (when the linear speed component is zero) 
 * to a curve (when both components are not zero) to a straight line (when the angular component is zero). <br>
 * When using move based methods the speed settings are used to calculate the speed at which a move can be made. 
 * If, for example, a very low angular speed has been set then this influences the speed at which an arc will be driven. 
 * The chassis makes sure the forward speed will be such that the angular speed will not exceed the specified setting. <p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Speed transitions</b><br>
 * To prevent jerky movements of the robot the velocity based methods {@link #setVelocity(double, double) setVelocity} and {@link #stop() stop} 
 * ensure smooth speed transitions using the acceleration settings that are specified using the 
 * {@link #setAcceleration(double, double) setAcceleration} method. 
 * This means that each of the wheels of the chassis takes exactly the same time to reach final speed, 
 * no matter what the speed of the wheels was at the moment the travel method was issued.<br>
 * The move based methods do not know these smooth transitions. 
 * These methods assume that the robot is at stand still when the method is issued and that the robot is at stand still again when the move ends. 
 * (Without this assumption it cannot be guaranteed that the trajectory of the robot has indeed the same shape as the method name implies.) 
 * 
 * <p><b>Odometry</b><br>
 * The chassis can provide a {@link lejos.robotics.localization.PoseProvider PoseProvider} that keeps track of the robots pose using the encoders of the wheels.
 * The object is provided by the {@link #getPoseProvider() getPoseProvider} method.</p>
