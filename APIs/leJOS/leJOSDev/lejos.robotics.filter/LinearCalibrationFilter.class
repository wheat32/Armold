/**
 * This filter is used to calibrate sensors for offset and scale errors using
 * linear interpolation. <br>
 * The filter has two modes of operation. In operational mode it corrects
 * samples coming from the sensor. In calibration mode the filter calculates
 * calibration parameters.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Operational mode</b><br>
 * In operational mode the filter corrects incoming samples for offset and scale
 * errors. The correction algorithm can uses calibration parameters for this.
 * These calibration parameters can be computed in calibration mode. They can
 * also be loaded from the filesystem using the load() method.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>How it works</b><br>
 * The correction algorithm uses two calibration parameters, offset and scale.<br>
 * The offset parameter corrects for offset errors. An offset error results in a
 * sample being a fixed amount off the truth: 2 becomes 3, 6 becomes 7. It is
 * corrected by subtracting a constant value (1 in this example) from the
 * sample, the offset error. <br>
 * The scale parameter corrects for scale errors. As a result of a scale error a
 * sample is always a fixed percentage off the truth: 2 becomes 3, 6 becomes 9.
 * It is corrected by dividing the sample with a constant value, the scale
 * error, 1.5 in this case. <br>
 * The combined correction formula is correctedValue = ( rawValue - offsetError
 * ) / scaleError. This calibration technique works on all sensors who's output
 * is linear to the input.<br>
 * If no correction parameters are calculated or loaded the filter uses 0 for
 * offset correction and 1 for scale correction.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>How to use the filter in operational mode</b><br>
 * In operational mode is the default mode. It is always active while the filter
 * is not calibrating. <br>
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <b>Calibration mode</b><br>
 * In calibration mode the two calibration parameters are calculated. This is
 * done by comparing samples to a user specified reference value and/or range.
 * Once calibration parameters are calculated they can be used immediately or
 * stored to the filesystem for later use using the store() method.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>How it works</b><br>
 * The CalibratorFiltersupports both offset and scale calibration. However both
 * are optional and can be enabled or disabled. During calibration the filter
 * collects minimum and maximum sample values. From this it calculates offset
 * (as the average of the minimum and maximum value corrected for the reference
 * value) and scale (as the difference between maximum and minimum value scaled
 * for range). To minimize the effect of sensor noise or sensor movements during
 * calculation sample values are low-passed before they are being used for
 * calibration.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>How to use the filter in calibration mode</b><br>
 * Calibration is started using the startCalibration method and ended with the
 * endCalibration method. During calibration the program that uses the filter
 * must fetch samples to collect data for the calibration algorithm. At the end
 * the calibration process the calculated calibration settings can be stored
 * using the store(filename) method. Calibration can be paused if needed.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>How to tune the calibration process</b><br>
 * There are three important parameters to the calibration process that can be
 * modified by the user program.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The reference value. This is the expected output of the sensor. For
 * calibrating a (motionless) gyro sensor this will be 0. For calibrating a
 * range sensor for example this should be the range to the object the sensor is
 * calibrated to. The reference value is used in calculating the offset
 * parameter, it is not used in calculating scale. The reference has a default
 * value of 0.</li>
 * <li>
 * The range value. This is the expected range of the sensor output. For
 * calibrating an accelerometer this could be 2*9.81 when the output should be
 * in m/s^2. The range value is used in calculating the scale parameter, it is
 * not used in calculating offset. The range has a default value of 2, meaning
 * sample values are normalized to a range of -1 to 1.</li>
 * <li>
 * The timeConstant value. This is the timeConstant value of a low-pass filter
 * that is used in calibration mode. A low pass filter is used during
 * calibration to for two reasons. First to overcome the effects of sensor noise
 * that could otherwise seriously affect range calculation. Secondly it filters
 * out the side effect of user manipulation when turning the sensor as part of
 * the calibration process (six way tumbling method). The parameter affects the
 * amount of smoothing of the low-pass filter. The higher the value, the
 * smoother the samples. Smoother samples are less affected by sensor noise or
 * external shocks but take longer to settle. The time constant has a default
 * value of 0, meaning no smoothing is done by default.</li>
 * </ul>
