/**
 *An  Arbitrator object  manages a behavior control system by starting and stopping individual  behaviors  
 *<br>  by the calling the <code>action()</code> and <code>suppress()</code> methods on them. 
 *<br>  These Behavior objects are stored in an array, in order of increasing priority. 
 *<br>  Arbitrator  has three major responsibilities: <br> 
 * 1. Determine the highest priority  behavior among those that returns <b> true </b> to <code>takeControl() </code>. <br>   
 * 2. Suppress the active behavior if its priority is less than highest
 * priority.   These two taska are performed the Arbitrator's internal Monitor thread.<br>   
 * 3. When the <code>action()</code> method exits, call <code> action() </code>on the Behavior of highest priority. <br>
 *       This task is  performed by the Arbitrator main thread. 
 * <br>  The Arbitrator assumes that a Behavior is no longer active when <code>action()</code> exits,
 * <br>  therefore it will only call <code>suppress()</code> on the active Behavior i.e.  whose <code>action()</code> method is running.
 * <br>  It can make consecutive calls of <code> action() </code>on the same Behavior.
 * <br>  Requirements for a Behavior:
 * <br>    When <code>suppress()</code> is called, terminate <code> action() </code>immediately.
 * <br>    When<code> action() </code>exits, the robot is in a safe state (e.g. motors stopped)
 * <br>    When the behavior should take control,  the <code> takeControl() </code> should continue to return <b> true </b>
 * <br>    until its action starts. 
 * <br> After your code instantiates the Arbitrator,  it should call <code>go() </code>to start it running.
