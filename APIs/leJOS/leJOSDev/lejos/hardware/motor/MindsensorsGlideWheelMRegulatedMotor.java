/**
 * Abstraction for a Mindsensors Glidewheel-M equipped PF motor.<br>
 * Note: These settings are for the "M" motor. This motor does not seem
 * to like running slowly, or to use acceleration values less than around
 * 500deg/s/s. Also tested with the "XL" motor which seems to work well other
 * than some oscillation when holding. We may need different settings for
 * the two.
 * TODO: Find some way to make this work with an I term for hold
 * TODO: Can probably be tuned better then this.
